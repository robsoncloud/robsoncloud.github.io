## Introduction
Integrating C# code within PowerShell can extend its capabilities significantly. By embedding custom C# classes, PowerShell can handle more complex operations such as event handling with a higher degree of control. 

In this post, I will walk you through a straightforward example of using pure C# code to instantiate a Timer object, expose its lapse event, and demonstrate how to subscribe to this event with a custom event handler in PowerShell.

## The Embedded C# Code
Let's start by embedding C# code in PowerShell. 

This C# snippet defines a ProcessMonitor class that triggers an event every second, incrementing a counter each time:

```powershell
$code = @"
using System;
using System.Timers;

namespace PowerShellEventDemo
{
    public class ProcessEventArgs : EventArgs
    {
        public string ProcessInfo { get; set; } // Holds process info
        public int Counter { get; set; } // Counter value
    }

    public class ProcessMonitor
    {
        public event EventHandler<ProcessEventArgs> TimeChanged; // Event to notify when timer elapses
        private int _counter = 0;
        private static Timer timer; // Timer instance

        public void Start()
        {
            timer = new Timer { Interval = 1000, AutoReset = true, Enabled = true }; // Timer setup
            timer.Elapsed += Timer_Elapsed; // Attach event handler
        }

        private void Timer_Elapsed(object sender, ElapsedEventArgs e)
        {
            _counter++; // Increment counter

            // Whenever the timer object emits an event it will raise our custom OnTimeChanged event that will be subscribed by our PowerShell code

            OnTimeChanged(new ProcessEventArgs // Raise event
            {
                ProcessInfo = String.Format("Counter: {0} Time: {1}", _counter, e.SignalTime),
                Counter = _counter
            });
        }

        protected virtual void OnTimeChanged(ProcessEventArgs e)
        {
            TimeChanged.Invoke(this, e); // Invoke event
        }

        public void Stop()
        {
            timer.Stop(); // Stop timer
        }
    }
}
"@

Add-Type -TypeDefinition $code  # Add the defined C# code to the current PowerShell session

```

## Setting Up Event Handling in PowerShell

With the C# class added to our PowerShell session, we can create an instance of ProcessMonitor and register an event handler using Register-ObjectEvent:

```powershell
# Creates an instance of the `ProcessMonitor` class defined in the embedded C# code
$monitor = New-Object PowerShellEventDemo.ProcessMonitor 

# Registers an event handler for the `TimeChanged` event, specifying the action to take when triggered
Register-ObjectEvent -InputObject $monitor -EventName TimeChanged -Action {
    
    # Extracts the event arguments passed to the handler
    $eventArgs = $Event.SourceEventArgs 
    
    Write-Host "PowerShell received: $($eventArgs.ProcessInfo)"

    # Checks if the counter has reached 10 and triggers the stop process 
    if ($eventArgs.Counter -eq 10) { 
        Write-Host "Counter: $($eventArgs.Counter) - Stop" -ForegroundColor Yellow
        $monitor.Stop() 

        # Unregisterr the event to prevent memory leak and remove the job
        Get-EventSubscriber | Unregister-Event
        Get-Job | Remove-Job
    }
}

# Start the timer
$monitor.Start() 
```

Running the code you should see the events being output to the console as the timer triggers each second:

## Conclusion
Embedding C# code in PowerShell scripts lets you take advantage of event handling, making it possible for automation tasks to respond dynamically to specific conditions. This example shows how PowerShellâ€™s flexibility can be combined with the power of C# to create more advanced scripting solutions.
